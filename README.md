# js-dice-roller
Simple javascript dice roller.

This is a simple javascript dice roller that I made years ago. There is not a whole lot to it but now that I am revisiting it years later I think I would like to update it.

Some future changes I would like to make:

1) Add ability to select different sized die's to roll at once. Example - 2 4 sides and 1 six sided.
2) Add more bells and whistles to the UI. Maybe sound. Animate the dice rolling.
